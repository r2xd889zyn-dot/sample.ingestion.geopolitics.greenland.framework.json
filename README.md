# Sample Ingestion Files — Millings Method

This directory contains sample ingestion records demonstrating how the
Millings Method captures and evaluates public commentary, media narratives,
and disputed claims.

## Purpose
These files are illustrative only. They show:
- How claims are recorded from public sources
- Which governance constraints are detected
- Why execution defaults to REFUSE when authority, artifacts, or binding language are absent

## How to Read These Files
- claims list reported assertions, not verified facts
- constraints_detected are governance flags, not accusations
- execution_result: "REFUSE" indicates a successful governance outcome
- No causation, intent, or truth determination is implied

## What These Files Are Not
- Not legal findings
- Not intelligence assessments
- Not policy recommendations
- Not enforcement triggers

## Governance Principle
The Millings Method prioritizes provenance, chronology, and restraint.
Narrative pressure or media amplification does not trigger execution.
